AtLAST - Horizon 2020 Design Study
Solar System Science Working Group Case Study

M. A. Cordiner, A. E. Thelen et al.


Introduction
  Summary of Solar System science at mm/sub-mm wavelengths
  Major instruments and results
  Types of bodies and environments studied
				Giant planets, terrestrial-type atmospheres, solid bodies, KBOs, comets, interstellar objects, asteroids, icy moons, ice giants, the Sun

  Describe key methodologies for sounding the atmosphere

  Chemistry (high-resolution spectroscopy)

  Dynamics (Doppler mapping)

  Thermal studies (gas and solids)

  Emission vs. absorption - Radiative transfer modeling

  The need for a larger aperture, multi-beam, single dish facility
    Higher sensitivity and dynamic range
    Lower PWV
    Higher spatial resolution
    Instantaneous multi-beam spectral mapping for improved spatial/temporal studies

Science case i: Giant planet atmospheres (including ice giants?)

Science case ii: Terrestrial-type atmospheres
  Venus
  Mars
  Titan

Science case iii: Icy moons (Enceladus, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Triton)
  Plumes
  Exospheres

Science case iv: KBOs ?

Science case v: Comets and interstellar objects

Summary of instrument requirements
  Sensitivity
  Spatial resolution
  Spectral coverage and resolution
  Mapping requirements (area, cadence, #pixels)
  Spectroscopic dynamic range
